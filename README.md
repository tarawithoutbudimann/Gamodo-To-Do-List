# Gamodo-To-Do-List
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a decline in productivity, especially in the education sector. According to a study by UNICEF
Indonesia, around 1% (1,243) of the total 123,235 children and adolescents aged 7-18 have dropped out of school due to the pandemic.
Although the reported number of children and adolescents who dropped out of school due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is only 1%
of the total number of children and adolescents aged 7-18 who were monitored, this indicates that a significant number of children and
adolescents throughout Indonesia may also not continue their education due to similar situations. The decrease in students' understanding of
learning materials is caused by difficulties in managing priorities in asynchronous distance learning, which indirectly contributes to the
increasing national illiteracy rate. To address this issue, a To-Do List program with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Python is needed to
help students manage their priorities more effectively. The program will be described with a system plan and flowchart and will be oriented
towards priority scales.
